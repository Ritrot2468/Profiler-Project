# Profiler

The "Profiler" project is a web application that collects information from the user about a product and the company's name. It then leverages the Google Search API and OpenAI to provide a summary of the company, estimate its funding, and assign a score. The project utilizes various technologies including Heroku, Vercel, React, Node.js, and TypeScript. The frontend part of the application is built with React, and the backend likely involves Node.js and TypeScript, with deployment handled by Heroku and Vercel. The repository's primary languages are JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS.
